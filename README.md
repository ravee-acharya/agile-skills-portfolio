## üìà What Drives Me

I thrive on analyzing team data to consistently enhance capacity and output. Every day is an opportunity to help teams grow, collaborate better, and exceed their goals. The tiny details in the data like Burndown charts, Team Velocity, Time to Release charts etc usually shows the exact opportunity for any organization and that's what keeps me motivated to leverage those details.
